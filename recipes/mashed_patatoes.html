    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <h4>For the mashed potatoes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds (about 8 medium) Yukon Gold or Russet potatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt (for boiling water)</li>
        <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk or heavy cream (warmed)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon white pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>For garnish</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh chives, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Additional 2 tablespoons butter for topping</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the potatoes:</strong> Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1-inch cubes of similar size to ensure even cooking. As you cut them, place the pieces in a bowl of cold water to prevent browning.</li>
        <li><strong>Boil the potatoes:</strong> Drain the potatoes and transfer to a large pot. Cover with cold water by 1 inch and add 1 tablespoon of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until the potatoes are very tender when pierced with a fork, about 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain thoroughly:</strong> Drain the potatoes in a colander and return them to the hot pot. Shake the pot gently over low heat for about 1 minute to evaporate any remaining moisture – this helps create fluffier mashed potatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Begin mashing:</strong> While the potatoes are still hot, begin mashing them using a potato masher or ricer. For ultra-smooth potatoes, use a food mill or ricer; for more rustic potatoes with some texture, use a traditional masher.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the butter:</strong> Add the butter pieces to the hot potatoes and continue mashing until the butter is fully melted and incorporated.</li>
        <li><strong>Add dairy:</strong> Slowly pour in the warm milk or cream while gently stirring with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Then fold in the sour cream until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the potatoes gluey.</li>
        <li><strong>Season:</strong> Add salt, white pepper, and garlic powder (if using). Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Transfer to a warm serving bowl, create a small well in the center, and add the additional butter. Sprinkle with fresh chives and black pepper. Serve immediately while hot.</li>
    </ol>
