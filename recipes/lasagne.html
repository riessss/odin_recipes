<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<h4>For the meat sauce</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 large onion, finely diced</li>
    <li>2 carrots, finely diced</li>
    <li>2 celery stalks, finely diced</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef</li>
    <li>1 pound (450g) Italian sausage, casings removed</li>
    <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 cans (28 oz each) crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
    <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<h4>For the béchamel sauce</h4>
<ul>
    <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>4 cups whole milk, warmed</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>Salt and white pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<h4>For assembly</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound (450g) lasagna noodles (no-boil or traditional, cooked according to package)</li>
    <li>16 oz (450g) mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
    <li>1 cup (100g) Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
    <li>8 oz (225g) ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, chopped (plus more for garnish)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the meat sauce:</strong> Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onions, carrots, and celery, cooking until softened, about 6-8 minutes. Add garlic and cook for another minute. Add ground beef and sausage, breaking it apart with a spoon, and cook until browned. Stir in tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes, bay leaves, herbs, and seasonings. Simmer uncovered for at least 1 hour (preferably 2-3 hours for deeper flavor), stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the béchamel sauce:</strong> In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add flour and whisk continuously for 2 minutes to make a roux. Gradually add warm milk, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 5-7 minutes until thickened. Add nutmeg, salt, and white pepper. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare for assembly:</strong> Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). If using traditional lasagna noodles, cook according to package directions until al dente, then drain and lay flat on clean kitchen towels. Mix ricotta with half of the Parmesan cheese and the chopped basil in a small bowl.</li>
    <li><strong>Begin assembly:</strong> Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping.</li>
    <li><strong>Create the layers:</strong> Spread 1/3 of the remaining meat sauce over the noodles. Dollop and spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture, then pour 1/3 of the béchamel sauce. Sprinkle with 1/3 of the mozzarella. Repeat these layers twice more, ending with a layer of noodles.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the top layer:</strong> Pour the remaining béchamel over the final layer of noodles, then sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake the lasagna:</strong> Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil (tent it slightly so it doesn't touch the cheese). Bake for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 25 minutes until the top is golden and bubbling.</li>
    <li><strong>Rest and serve:</strong> Remove from oven and let rest for 15-20 minutes before slicing. This helps the lasagna set and makes it easier to serve. Garnish with fresh basil leaves before serving.</li>
