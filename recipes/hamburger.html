    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>A perfectly juicy hamburger is an American classic and surprisingly simple to make at home.
        This recipe creates restaurant-quality burgers with a caramelized exterior and tender, flavorful interior.
        The key is quality ingredients and proper cooking technique.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <h4>For the burger</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ pounds (680g) ground beef (80/20 lean-to-fat ratio)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt        </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For serving</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 hamburger buns (brioche or potato buns work great)</li>
        <li>4 slices cheese (American, cheddar, or Swiss)</li>
        <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>Sliced tomato</li>
        <li>Sliced red onion</li>
        <li>Dill pickle slices</li>
        <li>Condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise)</li>
        <li>Butter for toasting buns (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the meat mixture:</strong> In a large bowl, gently combine the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Mix with your hands just until incorporated - overmixing will make the burgers tough.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the patties:</strong> Divide the meat into 4 equal portions. Form each portion into a ball, then gently press into a patty about ½-inch thick and 1 inch wider than your buns (they'll shrink when cooking). Press a slight dimple in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent the burgers from puffing up in the middle.</li> 
        <li><strong>Chill the patties:</strong> Place the formed patties on a plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours. This helps the patties hold their shape during cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat your cooking surface:</strong> Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill to medium-high heat. If using a grill, make sure it's clean and well-oiled to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the patties:</strong> Cook the burgers for 3-4 minutes on the first side without moving them. Flip once and cook for another 3-4 minutes for medium doneness (internal temperature of 160°F/71°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Add cheese:</strong> If using cheese, add a slice to each burger during the last minute of cooking and cover with a lid to help it melt.</li>
        <li><strong>Toast the buns:</strong> While the burgers are cooking, lightly butter the cut sides of the buns (if desired) and toast them on the grill or in a separate pan until golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble:</strong> Place each patty on a bottom bun, add your desired toppings and condiments, and top with the other half of the bun.</li>
    </ol>
